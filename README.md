# Shortest Path Algorithms Visualization

Welcome to the Shortest Path Algorithms Visualization repository! This repository contains a web-based visualization of the A* and Dijkstra shortest path algorithms, implemented using plain JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

## Algorithms Implemented

- **A\* Algorithm**: A popular pathfinding and graph traversal algorithm known for its performance and accuracy.
- **Dijkstra's Algorithm**: A classic algorithm for finding the shortest paths between nodes in a graph, which may represent, for example, road networks.

## Features

- **Path Highlighting**: See the shortest path highlighted once the algorithm completes.
- **Real-Time Updates**: Watch the algorithms work in real-time as they explore the grid.

## Live Demo
